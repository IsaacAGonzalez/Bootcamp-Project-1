# So-Cal Brew Hopper

UCSD Full Stack Flex Bootcamp - Project 1

University of California San Diego Cohort 2022

## Project Description:

So-Cal Brew Hopper is an interactive tool that allows the User to search for desired breweries in the San Diego area and turn their destination into a custom User bucket list. This will allow the User to actively track which breweries they have yet to visit, as well as remove them once their visit is completed. If the User is looking to stay in for the night, the app provides a featured cocktail recipe.
